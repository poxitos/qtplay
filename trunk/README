see qtplay --help for command-line arguments. notably you can save last.fm login
information with the following command:

qtplay -n username -p password --savePrefs


interactive control:

pgup / pgdn			seek backward/forward 1 minute
home / end			go to track start/end

known bugs:
- the first time a protected audio track is played, qtplay may crash. subsequent
	plays appear to work fine. please contact me if you find this to be the case
	
	
to do:
- sort out licensing
- test/support last.fm timeout and relogin
- refactor player/transport/stdin/signal
- refactor last.fm login into a non-echoing interactive setup
- man page
- configurable interactive keys
- support lastfm://
- handle stdin file list
